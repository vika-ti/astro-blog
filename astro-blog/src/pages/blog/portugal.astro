  <h1>Portugal: Porto Over Lisbon?</h1>
  <p>After exploring Portugal, one thing is clear - <strong>Porto is my favorite city</strong>. While Lisbon is the capital and has plenty of charm, Porto has a unique atmosphere that feels more authentic. The riverside views and architecture left a lasting impression for me!</p>

  <p>One thing that truly blew me away was <em>the Portuguese tarts</em> (pasteis de nata). These custard pastries are perfectly crisp on the outside and a creamy vanilla on the inside. I ate them almost daily!</p>

  <p>If you're planning a side trip, I highly recommend <strong>Aveiro</strong>. It's a small town nicknamed the "Venice of Portugal." It is great for a day trip with its canals and colorful boats, although there is not too much to do beyond just a few hours.</p>
